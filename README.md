# Learning Java + Spring


## Learning log

Day 1:

- The initial setup has been very challenging as I forgot my mysql credentials and had to go through a couple of hours of research for re-setting everything up. Application has been set up and the initial user and feature models were created.
- Installed several useful VS Code extensions that help me out importing stuff, autocompletion, and managing the Spring project and MySql server.
- So far so good, everything seems understandable and most of the things I see are things I can relate to from previous server programming experiences with PHP or Ruby.
